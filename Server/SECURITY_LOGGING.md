- **Data modification logging** for write operations
- **File operation logging** for upload/download events
- **Admin action logging** for administrative activities
- **Security violation logging** for suspicious activities
- **Error logging** for system errors

### 3. Log Monitor (`utils/logMonitor.js`)
- **Real-time log analysis** with configurable thresholds
- **Security alert generation** for critical events
- **Pattern detection** for suspicious activities
- **Performance monitoring** for system health
- **Automated reporting** for security events

### 4. Log Management API (`routes/logRoutes.js`)
- **Admin-only access** to log management endpoints
- **Log viewing and filtering** capabilities
- **Log download** functionality
- **Log cleanup** and retention management
- **Monitoring configuration** updates

## Log Files Structure

```
Server/logs/
├── security.log      # Security events and violations
├── error.log     # System errors and exceptions
├── access.log      # HTTP access logs

└── archive/        # Compressed old logs
```

## Security Event Types

### Authentication Events

- Data modification (create/update/delete)
- Sensitive data access
- Bulk data operations

### Security Violations
- Suspicious input detection
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attempts
- Rate limiting violations
- Unauthorized access attempts

### File Operations
- File uploads
- File downloads
- File deletions
- File integrity checks

### Admin Actions
- User management
- System configuration changes
- Log management operations
- Security settings updates

## Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "event": "authentication",
  "level": "info",
  "data": {
    "userId": "user123",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "action": "login",
    "success": true,
    "ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0..."
  },
  "source": "vehicle-services-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "integrityHash": "sha256_hash_here"
}
```

## Security Features

### Data Sanitization
- Automatic redaction of sensitive fields
- Password and token masking
- Personal information protection
- Credit card and SSN redaction

### Integrity Protection
- SHA-256 hashing for log entries
- Tamper detection capabilities
- Log file integrity verification

### Access Control
- Admin-only log access
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based permissions
- Audit trail for log access

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time log analysis
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Security event detection
- Performance monitoring

## API Endpoints

### Log Management
- `GET /api/logs/stats` - Get log statistics
- `GET /api/logs/security` - Get security events
- `GET /api/logs/errors` - Get error logs
- `GET /api/logs/access` - Get access logs
- `GET /api/logs/audit` - Get audit logs
- `GET /api/logs/report` - Generate security report

### Log Operations
- `GET /api/logs/download/:logType` - Download log files
- `DELETE /api/logs/cleanup` - Clean up old logs
- `PUT /api/logs/monitoring/thresholds` - Update monitoring thresholds
- `POST /api/logs/monitoring/:action` - Start/stop monitoring

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Logging configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=30
LOG_ROTATION_SIZE_MB=10

# Monitoring thresholds
FAILED_LOGIN_THRESHOLD=5

ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD=10
```

### Monitoring Thresholds
- **Failed Logins**: Alert after 5 failed attempts
- **Security Violations**: Alert after 3 violations
- **Error Rate**: Alert after 10 errors in 5 minutes
