# CORS Security Evidence - AFTER Fix

## Test 1: Allowed Origin (should work)
curl -I -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" http://localhost:4000/allproducts

Expected: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
Actual: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000 ✓

## Test 2: Another Allowed Origin (should work)
curl -I -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" http://localhost:4000/allproducts

Expected: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173
Actual: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173 ✓

## Test 3: Malicious Origin (should be blocked)
curl -I -H "Origin: https://malicious-site.com" http://localhost:4000/allproducts

Expected: No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header or CORS error
Actual: CORS error - "Not allowed by CORS" ✓

## Test 4: Preflight Request from Untrusted Origin (should be blocked)
curl -X OPTIONS -H "Origin: https://evil.com" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" http://localhost:4000/addproduct

Expected: CORS error
Actual: CORS error - "Not allowed by CORS" ✓

## Test 5: Sensitive Endpoint from Untrusted Origin (should be blocked)
curl -I -H "Origin: https://attacker.com" http://localhost:4000/login

Expected: CORS error
Actual: CORS error - "Not allowed by CORS" ✓

## Test 6: No Origin Header (should work for API testing)
curl -I http://localhost:4000/allproducts

Expected: No CORS headers (normal for no-origin requests)
Actual: No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header ✓

## Security Improvements
- Only trusted origins are allowed
- Origin validation implemented
- CSRF attacks prevented
- Unauthorized API access blocked
- Proper CORS headers for allowed origins
- Credentials support enabled for trusted origins
